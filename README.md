### A Computational Experiment for Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption 

This is the code to supplement the paper: "Computational and in vitro studies of blast-induced blood-brain barrier disruption". It is a 3D computational version of a blood-brain-barrier disruption experiment. It employs 2D axisymmetric Euler equations coupled with a Tammann equation of state. It includes implementations of new algorithms for the Lagrangian/Eulerian coupling of the air/water interfaces.

The code is designed to work with the Clawpack 5 software. For more information visit [the Clawpack webpage](http://www.clawpack.org/ ). The Clawpack software is open source, and the code is openly available at [Clawpack on GitHub](https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack). Some of the main algorithms used in this project can be found in the book [Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems](http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/book.html).
