This is the code to supplement the paper "Computational and in vitro studies of
blast-induced blood-brain barrier disruption". It is a 3D computational version  
of a blood-brain-barrier disruption experiment. It employs 2D axisymmetric Euler 
equations coupled with a Tammann equation of state. New algorithms to do a 
Lagrangian/Eulerian coupling of the air/water interface are implemented.
